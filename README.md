# Macco's Hammer
An all too prevalent alternative to Occam's Razor.

> "When presented with multiple explanations, the most convoluted, complex, and assumption-heavy answer is likely the correct one."

Or, more playfully:  

> "Never settle for a simple answer when a labyrinthine, over-engineered explanation could do the job."

### Some guiding principles of **Macco’s Hammer**:

- **More complexity = More credibility** – If a solution isn’t riddled with unnecessary steps, interdependencies, and speculative assumptions, it's probably missing something.
- **Over-explanation is key** – The longer it takes to describe, the closer it is to the truth.
- **Redundant justifications matter** – Any good theory should reference at least three unrelated fields of study for validation.
- **If it’s not convoluted, it’s probably wrong** – Assume reality is hiding behind layers of unnecessary intricacy.

Macco’s Hammer would be useful in situations where overcomplication thrives—**bureaucracy, conspiracy theories, and low level thinking** where obfuscation is a sign of intelligence.
