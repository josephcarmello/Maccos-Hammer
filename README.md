# Macco's Hammer

An all too prevalent alternative to Occam's Razor. 
---
> "When presented with multiple explanations, the most convoluted, complex, and assumption-heavy answer is likely the correct one."

Or, more playfully:  

> "Never settle for a simple answer when a labyrinthine, over-engineered explanation could do the job."

### Some guiding principles of **Macco’s Hammer**:

- **More complexity = More credibility** – If a solution isn’t riddled with unnecessary steps, interdependencies, and speculative assumptions, it's probably missing something.
- **Over-explanation is key** – The longer it takes to describe, the closer it is to the truth.
- **Redundant justifications matter** – Any good theory should reference at least three unrelated fields of study for validation.
- **If it’s not convoluted, it’s probably wrong** – Assume reality is hiding behind layers of unnecessary intricacy.

Macco’s Hammer would be useful in situations where overcomplication thrives—**bureaucracy, conspiracy theories, and low level thinking** where obfuscation is a sign of intelligence.

| **Principle**              | **Core Idea** | **Simple or Complex?** | **Example** |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Macco’s Hammer** 🛠️     | The most convoluted, assumption-heavy explanation is the correct one. | **Ultra-Complex** | Your missing car keys were likely taken by a time traveler who needed them to save the future. |
| **Occam’s Razor**          | The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. | Simple | If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras. |
| **Hickam’s Dictum**        | There can be multiple independent causes for a situation. | Complex | A patient can have multiple diseases rather than just one unifying diagnosis. |
| **Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword** | If something can’t be tested, it’s not worth arguing about. | Simple | Debating metaphysical ideas without evidence is pointless. |
| **Hanlon’s Razor**         | Stupidity is more likely than malice. | Simple | A coworker who messes up your project probably isn’t sabotaging you—just careless. |
| **Chesterton’s Fence**     | Don’t remove something until you understand why it exists. | Complex | Laws and traditions might have hidden purposes. |
| **Sagan’s Standard**       | Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. | Neutral | If someone says they saw an alien, strong proof is needed. |
| **Finagle’s Law**          | Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst time. | Complex | A computer will fail right before an important deadline. |
| **Principle of Maximum Entropy** | The most probable outcome is the one with the most disorder. | Complex | A messy desk is more likely than a perfectly organized one. |
